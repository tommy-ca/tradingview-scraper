base_preset: ../hygiene/institutional.yaml
markets: ["america"]

# Ensure we only emit the canonical proxy basket (symbols are matched by base
# symbol, so exchange aliases like AMEX/NYSEARCA are tolerated).
include_symbols:
  - "PDBC" # Broad commodities (actively managed roll)
  - "GLD"  # Gold
  - "SLV"  # Silver
  - "USO"  # Oil (WTI proxy)
  - "DBB"  # Industrial metals basket
  - "CPER" # Copper proxy
  - "DBA"  # Agriculture basket (optional diversifier)

# Pull enough rows so the include_symbols are guaranteed to appear if TradingView
# serves them (then we filter down).
