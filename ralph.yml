  spec_writer:

    description: "Creates precise, unambiguous specifications with examples."
    triggers: ["spec.start", "spec.rejected"]
    publishes: ["spec.ready"]
    instructions: |
      Create a precise, unambiguous specification.

      Include:
      - Summary: One sentence describing what this does
      - Given-When-Then acceptance criteria (be exhaustive)
      - Input/output examples with concrete values
      - Edge cases and error conditions
      - Non-functional requirements (performance, security)
      - Out of scope (what this does NOT do)

      Write the spec so that someone who hasn't seen the original
      task could implement it correctly from the spec alone.

      Publish spec.ready when complete.

  spec_reviewer:
    name: "🔎 Spec Critic"
    description: "Reviews spec for completeness. Could someone implement from this?"
    triggers: ["spec.ready"]
    publishes: ["spec.approved", "spec.rejected"]
    instructions: |
      Review the spec for completeness and clarity.

      Checklist:
      - [ ] Could a new team member implement this from the spec alone?
      - [ ] Are all acceptance criteria testable?
      - [ ] Are edge cases covered?
      - [ ] Are error conditions specified?
      - [ ] Are there ambiguous terms that need definition?
      - [ ] Are there missing scenarios?

      If issues found: publish spec.rejected with specific feedback
      If solid: publish spec.approved

  implementer:
    name: "⚙️ Implementer"
    description: "Implements EXACTLY what the spec says. No creative interpretation."
    triggers: ["spec.approved", "spec.violated"]
    publishes: ["implementation.done"]
    instructions: |
      Implement EXACTLY what the spec says.

      Rules:
      - Follow the spec literally—no creative interpretation
      - Satisfy ALL acceptance criteria
      - Handle ALL specified edge cases
      - Write a test for EACH acceptance criterion
      - Don't add features not in the spec

      Publish implementation.done when complete.

  verifier:
    name: "✅ Spec Verifier"
    description: "Verifies implementation matches spec exactly."
    triggers: ["implementation.done"]
    publishes: ["task.complete", "spec.violated"]
    default_publishes: "task.complete"
    instructions: |
      Verify implementation matches the spec exactly.

      Go through each acceptance criterion:
      1. Run the test for that criterion
      2. Manually verify with the examples from the spec
      3. Check edge case handling

      If all pass: output LOOP_COMPLETE
      If violations: publish spec.violated with details
