This is an institutional-grade Python framework for multi-asset quantitative portfolio management, built on top of real-time TradingView data scraping. It provides a full-lifecycle pipeline from discovery and risk optimization to high-fidelity backtesting and reporting.

## Key Capabilities

*   **13-Step Production Lifecycle**: Fully automated pipeline covering discovery, tiered pruning, secular backfill, and de-risked allocation.
*   **Convex Risk Engine (V2)**: Optimization utilizing **cvxpy** with institutional solvers (ECOS/OSQP) and strictly enforced hierarchical cluster caps (25%).
*   **3D Tournament Matrix**: Side-by-side benchmarking of 5 optimization engines (`skfolio`, `Riskfolio-Lib`, `PyPortfolioOpt`, `cvxportfolio`, and `custom`) across multiple simulators.
*   **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Professional friction modeling (5bps slippage, 1bp commission) via integrated **CVXPortfolio** simulator.
*   **Self-Healing Data Layer**: Automated gap detection, high-intensity repair (`make recover`), and 500-day secular history management.
*   **Markdown Tear-sheets**: Automated generation of strategy performance teardowns (Monthly returns, Drawdown audits) using **QuantStats**.
*   **Decision Trail Audit**: Full post-mortem logs (`selection_audit.md`) documenting every universe pruning and allocation choice.
*   **Reproducible Manifests**: Workflow profiles defined in schema-validated `configs/manifest.json` for consistent institutional operation.
*   **Live Output Example**: [Institutional Portfolio Implementation Gist](https://gist.github.com/tommy-ca/e888e1eab0b86447c90c26e92ec4dc36)

## Installation

To get started with the TradingView Scraper library, follow these steps:

1. **Install with uv** (recommended):
   ```sh
   curl -LsSf https://astral-sh.uv.io/install.sh | sh
   uv venv --python 3.12
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync --extra engines --extra engines-gpl --extra analytics --extra dev
   ```

## Automated Daily Pipeline

The entire production lifecycle is controlled via the `Makefile` and `configs/manifest.json`:

```bash
# Run the institutional production pipeline (Default)
make daily-run

# Run a lightweight development test (fast validation)
make daily-run PROFILE=repro_dev

# Run the 3D benchmarking tournament matrix only
make tournament
```

## Available Workflows

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make daily-run` | Standard production entry point. |
| `make tournament` | Run benchmarking matrix (Engine x Simulator x Profile). |
| `make recover` | High-intensity gap repair for degraded assets. |
| `make audit` | Verify logic constraints (Caps, Net Exposure, Weights). |
| `make gist` | Synchronize artifacts to private implementation Gist. |
