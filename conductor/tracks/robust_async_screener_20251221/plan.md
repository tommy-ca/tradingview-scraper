# Implementation Plan: Robust Async Screener Parity
**Track ID**: `robust_async_screener_20251221`
**Status**: Planned

## 1. Objective
Bring the `AsyncScreener` to full feature parity with the synchronous `Screener` while maintaining it as a separate, high-performance module.

## 2. Phases

### Phase 1: Parity & Resilience
Goal: Ensure the async screener is as reliable and feature-rich as the sync version.
- [x] Task: Sync all `SUPPORTED_MARKETS` and `DEFAULT_COLUMNS` constants to `screener_async.py`. 2caac14
- [x] Task: Implement async retry logic using `tenacity` for HTTP errors and rate limits. f59cd0b
- [x] Task: Integrate result export logic (`save_json_file`, `save_csv_file`). d95af00

### Phase 2: Performance & Pagination
Goal: Handle large-scale scans efficiently.
- [x] Task: Implement internal pagination in `AsyncScreener.screen` to support limits > 50. db08abc
- [ ] Task: Add a concurrency semaphore to `screen_many` to manage API pressure.

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Task: Verify parity via integrated tests comparing sync vs async results.
- [ ] Task: Final Report.
