# Plan: Robust WebSocket Retry Mechanism

This plan outlines the steps to implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the `Streamer` class.

## Phase 1: Research & Design [checkpoint: d67102c]
- [x] Task: Analyze current WebSocket handling in `tradingview_scraper/symbols/stream/streamer.py`
- [x] Task: Design the `RetryHandler` utility or integrate logic into `Streamer`
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Research & Design' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implementation (TDD)
- [x] Task: TDD - Write tests for exponential backoff calculation logic
- [x] Task: TDD - Implement exponential backoff utility (2e87bc3)
- [x] Task: TDD - Write tests for Streamer reconnection trigger
- [x] Task: TDD - Implement reconnection logic in `Streamer.stream` (6a11061)
- [x] Task: TDD - Write tests for state restoration after reconnect (ed85fe5)
- [x] Task: TDD - Implement state restoration (re-subscribing to symbols) (6a11061)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Finalization & Documentation
- [x] Task: Update `README.md` or documentation with new retry configuration options
- [x] Task: Add an example script demonstrating a resilient long-running stream
- [x] Task: Final project-wide linting and type checking
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Finalization & Documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
