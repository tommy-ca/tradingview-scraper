# Plan: Selection v2 vs v2.1 Performance Benchmark

## Phase 1: Benchmark Infrastructure
- [x] Task: Refactor `scripts/tournament_normalization.py` to include pure `v2` baseline.
- [x] Task: Add Turnover and Max Drawdown tracking to the tournament metrics.
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1'

## Phase 2: Tournament Execution
- [x] Task: Run head-to-head backtest: `v2` vs `v2.1_baseline_rank` vs `v2.1_opt_multi_norm`.
- [x] Task: Analyze symbol overlap (Turnover) to see if v2.1 selects different assets or just picks them better.
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2'

## Phase 3: Documentation & Standardization
- [x] Task: Final Research Report: `docs/research/v2_vs_v2_1_benchmark_2026.md`.
- [x] Task: Update `AGENTS.md` with the new performance benchmark results.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3'
