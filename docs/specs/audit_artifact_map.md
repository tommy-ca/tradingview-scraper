# Glossary & Map: Audit Artifacts

This document clarifies the roles and locations of the various "audit" files generated by the quantitative pipeline.

## 1. System-Level Audits (The Infrastructure)

### Audit Ledger (`audit.jsonl`)
- **Role**: Immutable, SHA-256 chained execution ledger.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/audit.jsonl`
- **Content**: Cryptographic fingerprint of every pipeline step, intent, outcome, and data hash.
- **Audience**: Forensic replay tools and compliance auditors.

### Resolved Manifest (`config/resolved_manifest.json`)
- **Role**: Snapshot of all settings and environment variables used for the run.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/config/resolved_manifest.json`
- **Audience**: Developers verifying precedence and replayability.

## 2. Decision Audits (The Logic)

### Selection Audit Data (`config/selection_audit.json`)
- **Role**: Technical JSON snapshot of discovery scans, merging results, and pruning logic.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/config/selection_audit.json`
- **Audience**: Downstream scripts requiring the raw discovery/veto data.

### Selection Audit Summary (`reports/selection/audit.md`)
- **Role**: Human-readable summary of the universe pruning process.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/selection/audit.md`
- **Audience**: Portfolio managers reviewing why specific assets were included or excluded.

### Selection Alpha Report (`reports/selection/report.md`)
- **Role**: Performance attribution of the selection process (Raw Pool vs. Filtered Universe).
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/selection/report.md`
- **Audience**: Researchers measuring "Selection Alpha".

## 3. Integrity Audits (The Data)

### Data Health Audit (`reports/selection/data_health_*.md`)
- **Role**: Detailed per-symbol health check (gaps, staleness, alignment).
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/selection/data_health_raw.md` (and `_selected.md`)
- **Audience**: Data engineers ensuring ingestion quality.

### Metadata Coverage Log (`logs/metadata_coverage.log`)
- **Role**: Trace of the metadata gate (tick size, precision) checks.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/logs/metadata_coverage.log`
- **Audience**: Automated guardrails and pipeline monitors.

---

## 4. Execution Audits (The Backtest)

### Rebalance Audit Log (`logs/rebalance_audit.log`)
- **Role**: Step-by-step trace of portfolio rebalancing decisions and drift triggers.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/logs/rebalance_audit.log`
- **Audience**: Traders verifying execution logic against simulated results.

### Alpha Isolation Audit (`reports/portfolio/alpha_isolation.md`)
- **Role**: Comparative breakdown of Selection Alpha vs. Optimization Alpha.
- **Location**: `artifacts/summaries/runs/<RUN_ID>/reports/portfolio/alpha_isolation.md`
- **Audience**: PMs optimizing the balance between pruning and weighting.
