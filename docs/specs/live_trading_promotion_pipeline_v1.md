# Live Trading Promotion Pipeline (v1)
**Status**: Proposal
**Date**: 2026-01-05

This document defines the end-to-end promotion path from:
**discovery → selection → portfolio construction → multi-simulator validation → live trading**,
while preserving institutional reproducibility and auditability.

Scope:
- Production promotion workflow and gates.
- Artifact contracts required to turn a validated portfolio into executable orders.
- Separation between **production gates** and **research-only diagnostics**.

Non-goals (v1):
- Implementing broker/exchange-specific adapters (code); this is a spec/roadmap.
- Weakening strict-scoreboard gates to “force” candidates.

## 1) End-to-End Stages (L0–L6)

### L0 — Discovery (Scanners)
Goal:
- Produce a broad, tagged candidate set across venues/asset types with deterministic configs.

Inputs:
- Manifest profile + pipelines (`discovery.pipelines`).
- Layered scanner configs (L0–L4) per `docs/specs/pipeline_composition.md`.

Outputs (run-scoped):
- `export/<RUN_ID>/universe_selector_*.json` (scan payloads)
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_candidates_raw.json` (canonical raw pool)

Audit:
- Record scan inputs/outputs + counts in `audit.jsonl`.

### L1 — Canonical Data Prep (Raw Pool)
Goal:
- Fetch enough history to run selection audits and clustering.

Outputs:
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_returns_raw.pkl`
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_meta_raw.json`
- Metadata enrichment applied to candidates.

Gate:
- Metadata coverage guardrail (canonical).

### L2 — Natural Selection (Candidate Universe)
Goal:
- Convert raw pool → selected candidate universe using SelectionEngine v3.2 (default), with audit provenance.

Outputs:
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_candidates.json`
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_returns.pkl`
- Selection audit artifacts (`selection_audit.json` / `.md` and/or per-window `backtest_select` outcomes in `audit.jsonl`)

Gate:
- Metadata coverage guardrail (selected).
- (Policy pending) selected freshness/STALE handling should be strict for production.

### L3 — Portfolio Construction (Allocation)
Goal:
- Build implementable portfolios from the selected universe using proven allocation engines + constraints.

Outputs:
- `data/lakehouse/portfolio_optimized_v2.json` (weights, constraints, exposures)

Gate:
- Risk constraints are enforced and recorded (cluster caps, turnover penalties, tail-risk controls).

### L4 — Validation (Multi-Simulator Backtests)
Goal:
- Prove robustness across windowing and simulator assumptions.

Core tools:
- `make port-test` (tournament)
- optional sweeps: `scripts/research/grand_4d_tournament.py`
- strict scoreboard: `scripts/research/tournament_scoreboard.py`

Outputs:
- `tournament_results.json` (+ per-cell artifacts for 4D sweeps)
- `data/tournament_scoreboard.csv`, `data/tournament_candidates.csv`, `reports/research/tournament_scoreboard.md`

Hard gates (institutional):
- strict-scoreboard yields at least one **non-baseline** strict candidate for the production-parity mini-matrix.
- ledger hash chain verifies (`scripts/archive/verify_ledger.py`).
- selected universe passes strict health audit (`make data-audit STRICT_HEALTH=1`) for production promotion.

### L5 — Paper Trading / Shadow Execution (Pre-Live)
Goal:
- Translate validated portfolios into executable orders and run in paper mode with full telemetry.

Required artifacts:
- `orders.json` (or equivalent) derived from `portfolio_optimized_v2.json` + current positions.
- execution logs + fills (paper) archived under run scope.

Gates:
- Order generation is deterministic for the same inputs (positions + portfolio weights).
- Slippage / turnover / constraint violations are measured and archived.

### L6 — Live Trading (Production)
Goal:
- Execute the same audited portfolio logic on real venues.

Requirements:
- Broker/exchange adapters per venue class.
- Risk controls: max leverage, max notional per asset, kill-switch.
- Observability: fills, latency, rejects, drift, PnL attribution.

Institutional policy:
- Live runs must archive the manifest snapshot + decision ledger chain.
- Any manual intervention must be logged as an explicit audited action (no silent overrides).

## 2) Venue / Exchange Coverage (Discovery → Implementation)

We expand venues breadth-first, but we do not mix calendars without explicit policy.

Venue classes:
- **TradFi equities/ETFs** (session-based)
- **Bonds/commodities proxies** (often via ETFs; session-based)
- **Forex** (near-24/5; session-aware)
- **Futures** (contract-specific sessions; roll policies)
- **Crypto CEX** (24/7; freshness constraints)
- **CFDs** (broker-defined sessions; higher operational risk)

Policy (v1):
- Treat each venue class as its own perspective/sleeve unless calendars and risk assumptions are explicitly normalized.
- Prefer ETFs as proxies when the underlying asset is operationally complex (e.g., commodities/futures) until roll/contract logic is production-grade.

---

## 3) “Atoms” and Multi-Sleeve Portfolios

We build portfolios over atoms, not just tickers:
- instruments and ETFs (production),
- strategies and public portfolios (research-first).

Spec:
- `docs/specs/universe_atoms_and_perspectives_v1.md`

Production default (near-term):
- Two sleeves: `instrument` (selected winners) + `etf_proxy` (macro diversification).
- Allocate within sleeves, then allocate across sleeves (HRP at sleeve level).

---

## 4) Promotion Gates Checklist (Production)

Before promoting a configuration to live execution:
1. **Discovery + selection reproducible** (manifest snapshot present, ledger verifies).
2. **Selected universe health**: `make data-audit STRICT_HEALTH=1` passes.
3. **Strict-scoreboard**: non-empty **non-baseline** strict candidates under production-parity mini-matrix.
4. **Baseline anchors visible**: `benchmark` is present and treated as a reference row in ranking outputs.
5. **Simulator matrix sanity**: parity / friction / fragility signals are within expected bounds (and any research-only diagnostics are recorded, not silently gating).
6. **Order generation**: deterministic, constraint-aware, and auditable.
7. **Paper trading burn-in**: sufficient duration to observe operational failure modes.

## 5) Roadmap (Concrete Next Steps)

Near-term (production parity):
- Add ETF proxy sleeve discovery and validate with a smoke tournament.
- Resolve selected STALE handling so strict health is a reliable production gate.

Mid-term (research → production):
- Strategy-atom universe: cluster strategies and evaluate whether diversity predicts strict survival.
- Smart-money portfolio atoms: ingestion + bias controls; remain research-only until reproducibility is proven.
