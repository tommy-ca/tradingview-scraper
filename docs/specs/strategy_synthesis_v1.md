# Specification: Strategy Synthesis (v1.0)

## 1. Objective
Enable the platform to optimize across not just assets, but **Synthesized Return Streams** generated by specific trading logic (Momentum, Mean Reversion, Trend Following).

## 2. The Atomic Strategy Concept
An "Atomic Strategy" is defined as a triplet of $(Asset, Logic, TimeScale)$.
- **Example**: `(BTCUSDT, MTF_Trend, 1h)`
- **Output**: A series of percentage returns representing the performance of that logic on that asset.

## 3. Integration Standard
Portfolio engines must treat these synthesized returns as "Primary Assets." 

### 3.1 Composite Returns
$R_{composite} = R_{raw} \times Signal_{logic}$
Where $Signal \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

### 3.2 Optimization Flow
1. **Synthesis Layer**: Generate return matrices for all enabled atomic strategies.
2. **Strategic Layer**: Optimize across return streams using risk-parity or max-sharpe.
3. **Execution Layer**: Aggregate weights back to physical assets for implementation.

## 4. Time-Scale Composing
The platform must support composing atomic strategies from different timeframes (e.g., 5m mean-reversion with 1d trend-following).
- **Joining Policy**: All strategies must be up-sampled or down-sampled to the **Optimization Step Size** (e.g., 20 days) while preserving the high-frequency drawdown characteristics of the source logic.
