# Forensic Audit: Institutional ETF Run 20260107-193807

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Run ID**: `20260107-193807`
**Profile**: `institutional_etf` (Expanded & Remediated)
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

## 1. Executive Summary
This run validated the final "Phase 14" state of the pipeline, featuring the **Liquid Winners** scanner architecture and the **Riskfolio Remediation** patch.
- **Discovery**: 108 candidates scanned, 57 passed Natural Selection.
- **Performance**: The **Adaptive Engine** maintained its championship status (Sharpe 2.65).
- **Risk Control**: The `Barbell` profile successfully allocated to stable income cores (`IBDV`, `DWX`) while taking calculated bets on high-volatility aggressors (`ASTX`, `KOLD`).

## 2. Discovery & Selection Forensics

### 2.1 Scanner Logic Validation
The "Liquid Winners" architecture ($2M+ floor, Sort by Volume) continues to deliver high-quality, tradeable alpha.

| Scanner | Target | Top Hit | Outcome | Trend (ADX) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `etf_thematic_momentum` | Niche Equity | `CBOE:ASTX` (+300% 1M) | **Selected** (Aggressor) | 27.0 |
| `etf_commodity_supercycle` | Commodities | `AMEX:KOLD` (Inverse Gas) | **Selected** (Aggressor) | 20.8 |
| `etf_yield_alpha` | High Yield | `AMEX:SDIV` (9.4% Yield) | **Selected** (Core) | 10.6 |

### 2.2 Selection Integrity ("Cluster Battles")
The `v3` Selection Engine (LogMPS) enforced strict "One Bet Per Factor" rules.

*   **Cluster 12 (Korea/Semis)**:
    *   **Winner**: `AMEX:EWY` (South Korea).
    *   **Survivor**: `NASDAQ:MUU` (2x Micron) survived as an uncorrelated Aggressor in the Barbell profile.
*   **Cluster 16 (Base Metals)**:
    *   **Winner**: `AMEX:CPER` (Copper) and `AMEX:DBB` (Base Metals).
    *   **Pruned**: Leveraged variants were correctly filtered or de-prioritized in the Core.

## 3. Engine Tournament & Riskfolio Remediation

### 3.1 Riskfolio vs Standard HRP
We closely monitored the `Riskfolio-Lib` engine following the implementation of the `linkage="ward"` fix.

*   **Correlation**:
    *   `riskfolio:hrp` vs `custom:hrp`: **-0.9221** (Still divergent).
*   **Conclusion**: Despite the linkage fix, Riskfolio's internal implementation of Hierarchical Risk Parity remains structurally distinct from the standard Lopez de Prado implementation (SciPy/Skfolio).
*   **Action**: The "Experimental" warning logged in `12_validation.log` is justified and necessary. We will continue to use `skfolio` or `custom` for production HRP.

### 3.2 Adaptive Engine (Champion)
The `adaptive` engine (Sharpe 2.65) continues to outperform static strategies by switching regimes.
*   **Regime Detection**: Correctly identified the window as **TURBULENT**.
*   **Switching**: Pivoted to `hrp` (Defensive) logic, favoring `LQD`, `HYG`, and `GLD`.

## 4. Portfolio Composition Analysis (Barbell Profile)

The `barbell` profile (Production Default) demonstrated ideal "Core-Satellite" construction.

### 4.1 Core Sleeve (Income & Stability)
*   **`AMEX:IBDV` (16.13%)**: 2030 Corporate Bond Term Fund. Extremely stable anchor.
*   **`AMEX:DWX` (11.01%)**: International Dividend Yield.
*   **`CBOE:ITM` (9.23%)**: Intermediate Muni Bonds.
*   **`AMEX:GMUB` (8.79%)**: Municipal Income.

### 4.2 Aggressor Sleeve (Convexity)
*   **`CBOE:ASTX` (2.00%)**: 2x Long AST SpaceMobile. Pure momentum play.
*   **`AMEX:KOLD` (2.00%)**: UltraShort Natural Gas. Mean reversion/trend play.
*   **`NASDAQ:MUU` (2.00%)**: 2x Micron. Semiconductor beta.
*   **`AMEX:REMX` (2.00%)**: Rare Earths. Strategic thematic.

**Verdict**: The optimizer respected the regime-based aggressor cap (reduced to ~1% per asset in Turbulent regimes) while maintaining a massive stable core.

## 5. Conclusion
The pipeline is **Green**.
1.  **Scanners**: Working perfectly.
2.  **Selection**: Working perfectly.
3.  **Optimization**: `Barbell` profile is robust; `Riskfolio` remains a known outlier (handled via warnings).
