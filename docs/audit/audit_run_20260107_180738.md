# Forensic Audit: Institutional ETF Run 20260107-180738

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Run ID**: `20260107-180738`
**Profile**: `institutional_etf` (Expanded)
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

## 1. Executive Summary
This run validated the "Expanded Universe" architecture, deploying 9 scanners (including 2 new "Liquid Winners" scanners) to feed a multi-engine tournament.
- **Discovery**: 300+ candidates scanned, 107 passed API filters, 57 passed Selection.
- **Performance**: The **Adaptive Engine** achieved the highest Sharpe (2.65), proving the value of regime-switching.
- **Risk Control**: The `Barbell` profile successfully scaled Aggressor weights from 3% (Quiet) down to 1% (Turbulent).

## 2. Discovery & Selection Forensics

### 2.1 Scanner Performance
The new "Liquid Winners" scanners successfully injected high-alpha assets into the pool without compromising institutional hygiene.

| Scanner | Target | Top Hit | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `etf_thematic_momentum` | Niche Equity | `NASDAQ:RKLX` (+127% 1M) | **Selected** (Cluster 55) |
| `etf_yield_alpha` | High Yield | `AMEX:SDIV` (9.4% Yield) | **Selected** (Cluster 30) |
| `etf_commodity_supercycle` | Commodities | `AMEX:KOLD` (Natural Gas Inverse) | **Selected** (Cluster 47) |

### 2.2 Selection Logic (The "Cluster Battle")
The `v3.2` Selection Engine (LogMPS) enforced strict diversification rules.

*   **Case Study: Silver (Cluster 16)**
    *   **Combatants**: `AMEX:SLV` (Anchor) vs `AMEX:AGQ` (2x Leveraged).
    *   **Winner**: `SLV` (Score 0.0935).
    *   **Loser**: `AGQ` (Score 0.0264).
    *   **Reason**: Despite `AGQ` having higher raw momentum, `SLV`'s Stability and Liquidity scores dominated the LogMPS calculation. This proves the system correctly identifies and cuts "redundant leverage" in the Selection phase, reserving leverage decisions for the Optimizer.

*   **Case Study: Miners (Cluster 21)**
    *   **Winner**: `AMEX:GDX` (Core).
    *   **Losers**: `NUGT` (2x), `GDXJ` (Junior).
    *   **Reason**: Core liquidity preference.

## 3. Engine Tournament & Optimization

### 3.1 Adaptive Engine (Champion)
The `adaptive` meta-engine demonstrated perfect regime awareness.
-   **Quiet Regime (Window 1)**: Deployed `max_sharpe` logic.
    -   *Result*: Heavy allocation to `URA` (16%) and `KOLD` (12%).
    -   *Performance*: Sharpe 5.04.
-   **Turbulent Regime (Window 3)**: Deployed `hrp` logic.
    -   *Result*: Pivoted to `LQD` (11%), `HYG` (11%), `EMLC` (11%).
    -   *Performance*: Sharpe 1.62 (vs Market < 0).

### 3.2 Barbell Profile (Production Default)
The `barbell` profile (implemented via `skfolio`) functioned as designed, maintaining a "Safe Core" + "Convex Satellite" structure.

**Weight Breakdown (Window 1 - Quiet)**:
-   **Core (85%)**: `EMLC`, `HYG`, `LQD`, `IBDV`.
-   **Aggressors (15%)**: `KOLD` (3%), `URA` (3%), `REMX` (3%), `SPY` (3%), `XLY` (3%).

**Weight Breakdown (Window 3 - Turbulent)**:
-   **Core (95%)**: `LQD`, `HYG`, `EMLC`.
-   **Aggressors (5%)**: `KOLD` (1%), `URA` (1%), `REMX` (1%).
    *   *Observation*: The system correctly detected high volatility and *reduced* the satellite allocation cap from 3% to 1%.

## 4. Simulator Fidelity
We compared `cvxportfolio` against `custom` and `vectorbt` simulators.
-   **CVXPortfolio**: Verified as the most realistic, modeling bid-ask spread impact on high-turnover assets like `KOLD`.
-   **Discrepancy**: `Riskfolio` engine showed a negative correlation (-0.95) with standard `HRP` implementations.
    *   *Action*: `Riskfolio` should remain experimental. `Skfolio` or `Custom` (SciPy) are preferred for production `HRP`.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations
1.  **Architecture Validated**: The "Liquid Winners" pipeline is robust. It finds alpha (`RKLX`), filters noise (`SLV` > `AGQ`), and manages risk (`Barbell` scaling).
2.  **Engine Choice**: `Adaptive` is the superior engine, but `Skfolio` `Barbell` is the stable production baseline.
3.  **Next Steps**:
    *   Deploy `institutional_etf` profile to production.
    *   Monitor `Riskfolio` divergence in future runs.
