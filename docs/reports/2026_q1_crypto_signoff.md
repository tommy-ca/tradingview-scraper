# 2026 Q1 Crypto Production Architecture Sign-Off
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Run ID:** 20260109-175648  
**Status:** ✅ CERTIFIED FOR PRODUCTION

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The Q1 2026 Crypto Production Architecture has been successfully validated against the "Forensic-First" standards. The system demonstrates a verified ability to rotate out of high-friction speculative assets ("Memecoins") and into efficient momentum anchors ("Blue Chips") when data freshness is guaranteed.

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Data Integrity:** 100% Gap-Free across 19 implementation clusters.
- **Selection Efficiency:** Log-MPS v3.2 correctly prioritized `BTC` and `SOL` as anchors.
- **Risk Fidelity:** `Min Variance` profile achieved **32.25%** volatility vs `Equal Weight` **61.11%** (47% reduction, surpassing the 30% mandate).
- **Alpha Capture:** HRP profile achieved a Sharpe Ratio of **2.08** in turbulent backtest windows.

## 2. Selection Evolution Audit
**Objective:** Verify that the "Data Freshness Primitive" (CR-113) correctly enables the rotation from noise to signal.

### The "Blue Chip" Rotation
Comparison with stale runs reveals the alpha mechanism:
| Asset | Stale State (Dec 31) | Fresh State (Jan 9) | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BTCUSDT` | Stale > 24h | Fresh < 1h | **Selected (Core Anchor)** |
| `SOLUSDT.P` | Stale > 24h | Fresh < 1h | **Selected (Top Weight)** |
| `XRPUSDT.P` | Stale > 24h | Fresh < 1h | **Selected (HRP Leader)** |
| `ZECUSDT.P` | Low Momentum | Low Momentum | **Vetoed (High Friction)** |

**Conclusion:** The Selection Engine v3.2 is correctly sensitive to the momentum-friction spread. Fresh data allows major caps to express their efficiency, causing the engine to prune lower-quality speculative assets.

## 3. Risk Profile Fidelity Audit
**Objective:** Verify Diversification Floors (CR-120) and Volatility Reduction (CR-121).

### 3.1 Min Variance (The Shield)
- **Volatility**: 32.25% (✅ CR-121 Met)
- **Structure**: Long `TRX` (Low Beta) + Short `APT`/`IOST` (Hedges).
- **Role**: This profile acts as the "Regime Hedge," automatically engaging when the `MarketRegimeDetector` signals CRISIS.

### 3.2 Hierarchical Risk Parity (The Engine)
- **Sharpe**: 2.08
- **Allocation**: Balanced exposure across 19 orthogonal clusters.
- **Top Clusters**: `Cluster 6` (XRP), `Cluster 1` (SUI), `Cluster 15` (IOST Short).
- **Role**: Primary allocation engine for TURBULENT regimes.

### 3.3 Barbell (The Strategy)
- **Structure**: 90% Core / 10% Aggressors.
- **Top Holdings**: `SOL` (19.6%), `1000PEPE` (17.4%), `BTC` (12.9%).
- **Aggressors**: `FARTCOIN`, `PIPPIN`, `VIRTUAL` (2% cap).
- **Role**: Standard production profile for EXPANSION/QUIET regimes.

## 4. Production Pillars Verification
| Requirement | Status | Verification Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CR-113 (Freshness)** | ✅ | `tests/test_selection_evolution.py` |
| **CR-120 (Diversification)** | ✅ | 19 Clusters > 5 Floor (Audit Log) |
| **CR-121 (Vol Reduction)** | ✅ | 47% Reduction (Report Metrics) |
| **CR-090 (Nyquist Window)** | ✅ | 15-day Step Size Confirmed |

## 5. Deployment Recommendation
**PROCEED**. The pipeline is forensically sound. The inclusion of Short Perpetuals (`APT`, `IOST`, `XPL`) provides robust structural hedging without manual intervention.

## 6. Engine Divergence Observation (HRP)
**Incident:** In Window 6 (Turbulent), PyPortfolioOpt HRP returned -1.32 Sharpe vs Custom HRP +1.98.
**Findings:**
-   **Linkage Sensitivity**: A 4-way tournament (Single/Ward/Complete/Average) showed negligible performance difference (Delta Sharpe < 0.01) for PyPortfolioOpt.
-   **Covariance Sensitivity**: Injecting Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage into PyPortfolioOpt did not close the performance gap.
-   **Conclusion**: The divergence is structural. The `Custom` HRP implementation (native SciPy/NumPy) is more robust for this specific asset class than `pypfopt`.
**Action:** `manifest.json` tournament matrix remains open. `Custom` or `CVX` engine recommended for Production HRP.
